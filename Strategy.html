		units<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/electronic-strategy-game" target="_blank">(source)</a>  .The strategy genre has its 
		roots in traditional table top gaming. With games such as chess and Go. A game in the genre can typically be categorized under

		<p>Real time strategy games are similar to turn based strategy games with the main difference being that the game runs in real time, though often can be paused. Out of the real time strategy genre the multiplayer online  battle arena(moba) genre has been created. 
		The moba genre takes many real-time strategy elements<a href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RealTimeStrategy" target="_blank">(source).</a></p>

		<h3 id="TurnBased" class="margin">Turn Based:</h3>
		<p>Turn based strategy games are similar to real time strategy games with the main difference being that each side takes a turn rather than playing in real time. Turn based stategy gameplay lends itself well to the jrpg genre creating the tactical rpg genre
